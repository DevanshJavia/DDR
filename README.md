Rock, paper, scissor game is the name of our project. It is a very familiar two-person game. A fun game based on the Fingerpose gesture detection.
This program is a simple rock, paper, scissors game where the player has to choose one of the three options to beat the computer.

Let’s see how this program works:
The computer will generate a random option by creating a number to indicate that option. 1 will be 'rock', 2 will be 'paper', and 3 will be 'scissors' 
respectively.
	•	Rock beats Scissors.
	•	Scissors beats Paper.
	•	Paper beats Rock.
	•	First player to win 3 rounds is the winner.
	•	Play again!
